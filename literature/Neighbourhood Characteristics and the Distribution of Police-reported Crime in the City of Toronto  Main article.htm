  <h2 id="h2_1" class="RGB">1 &#160;&#160;Introduction</h2>
  <p>This research paper explores the spatial distribution of police-reported
crime in the city of Toronto. The relationships between neighbourhood characteristics
and crime rates are examined. The analyses are based on data from the&#160;2006&#160;Census
and police-reported crime data from the&#160;2006&#160;Incident-based Uniform
Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2).</p>
  <p>This study is part of a series of spatial analyses of crime data in Canadian
cities conducted by Statistics Canada. Other cities that have been analysed
include: Edmonton, Halifax, Montr&#233;al, Regina, Saskatoon, Thunder Bay
and Winnipeg. These studies, which have been funded by the National Crime
Prevention Centre at Public Safety Canada, examine the relationships between
the spatial distribution of crime and neighbourhood characteristics.</p>
  <p>Spatial analysis of crime data provides a visual representation of areas
of concentrated crime. It also helps identify neighbourhood characteristics
that are related to crime levels. It can be an important tool in the development
and implementation of crime reduction strategies.</p>
  <p>The various mapping studies undertaken by the Canadian Centre for Justice
Statistics support an ecological view of crime, more specifically, the social
disorganization and crime opportunity theories. In keeping with this approach,
the juxtaposition of the spatial distribution of police-reported crime and
the environmental characteristics of neighbourhoods is examined to determine
whether certain local characteristics (e.g. economic status of the residents
and economic activity) are likely to foster crime. This report does not look
at the individual characteristics of perpetrators or victims of crime, but
rather at the characteristics of the neighbourhood environment.</p>
  <p>In the Canadian context, the studies on neighbourhood characteristics and
the distribution of crime (Fitzgerald, Wisener and Savoie&#160;2004; Savoie,
B&#233;dard and Collins&#160;2006; Wallace, Wisener and Collins&#160;2006;
Kitchen&#160;2006; Andresen and Brantingham&#160;2007; Charron&#160;2008;
Savoie&#160;2008a; Savoie&#160;2008b) have shown that crime is not randomly
distributed within cities, but that it is concentrated in certain neighbourhoods.</p>
  <p>Data from the Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey are reported
by the police and provide a particular perspective on the nature and extent
of crime, that is, they cover only crimes known to the police. Many factors
can influence the reporting of offences by police services, including the
public's willingness to report crimes to the police and changes in legislation,
policies or enforcement practices.</p>
  <p>The Census of Population is conducted by Statistics Canada every five years,
and was last carried out in&#160;2006. To achieve the highest degree of compatibility
between crime data and neighbourhood characteristics derived from the Census,
this paper draws on police and Census data from&#160;2006.</p>

  <p>Results are presented in three sections. The first includes a profile of
the city of Toronto, its residential structure and the spatial organization
of its economical activities, while the second section provides an account
of crimes reported by the Toronto Police Service. The concentrations of violent
and property crime rates are examined as well as the corresponding neighbourhood
characteristics. In the third section, spatial regressions are used to examine
the relationships between the rates of&#160;15&#160;types of crimes and neighbourhood
characteristics. This approach provides a better understanding of the contextual
elements associated with local crime rates.</p>
  <h3>2.1&#160;&#160;Portrait of the city of Toronto&#160;<a href="fnpart-fnpartie1-eng.htm#fn1" title="Note 1"><sup>1</sup></a>&#160;</h3>
  <p>The Toronto urban area is the centre of the Greater Golden Horseshoe, an
extensive urban zone bordering the western end of LakeOntario from Oshawa
to St. Catharines&#8211;Niagara.This places Toronto at the heart of a vast
metropolitan system that includes&#160;9&#160;of the country's&#160;33&#160;census
metropolitan areas (CMA) and over&#160;8,000,000&#160;inhabitants (nearly
one quarter of Canada's population). At over&#160;5,000,000&#160;inhabitants,
Toronto was the most populous CMA in Canada in&#160;2006</p>
  <p>The city of Toronto, which is the subject of this study, had a population
of over&#160;2,500,000&#160;in&#160;2006. It is the capital city of Ontario
as well as the most populous city in Canada.Toronto is also considered to
be a global city, since it represents a major economic hub in the global economy
(Foreign Policy&#160;2008).</p>
  <p>Toronto plays a key role in international finance. In&#160;2006, the city
accounted for nearly one quarter of the country's employment in the
finance and insurance industry, providing&#160;158,205&#160;jobs in that sector.The
manufacturing, retail trade, health, and professional and technical services
industries provided more than&#160;150,000&#160;jobs each in Toronto.</p>
  <p>Toronto's economic activities attract a high volume of skilled workers.
In&#160;2006,&#160;30% of Torontonians had a university degree, compared to
the national average of&#160;18%.The strong economy also accounted for an
average property value ($413,574) and average individual income ($40,376)
that figured significantly above the national averages ($263,369&#160;and&#160;$35,498).</p>
  <p>However, these indicators do not reflect the wide economic gaps among Toronto's
residents. In fact, unlike the average income, the median individual income
was lower in Toronto ($24,544) than elsewhere in Canada ($25,615).This difference
in average and median individual incomes indicates that a small percentage
of Toronto workers earn high wages, thereby increasing the average income
significantly. In other words, compared with other CMAs, income inequality
is considerable in the Toronto CMA (Myles et al.&#160;2000).</p>
  <p>In addition, part of the wealth generated in Toronto does not directly
benefit the city's residents.Nearly one third of the jobs located in
the city of Toronto (484,090&#160;out of&#160;1,514,870) were held by workers
living in another municipality.This is perhaps not entirely unrelated to the
fact that the unemployment rate was higher in Toronto (7.6%) than in the other
municipalities of the CMA (6.1%).</p>
  <p>Toronto's global nature is also evident in the cultural diversity
of its population.In&#160;2006, about&#160;1&#160;Torontonian in&#160;5&#160;(456,815)
was a recent immigrant, having lived in the country for less than&#160;10&#160;years.
In fact, almost one quarter of all recent immigrants in the country lived
in the city of Toronto.</p>
  <p>The mass influx of international immigrants to Toronto over the past several
decades has made it one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world.In&#160;2006,
more than half of Toronto's residents had been born outside of the country
(51%) and nearly half were visible minorities (47%).These percentages are
high, particularly when compared with those of the rest of the country (17%
and&#160;14% respectively).Toronto's visible minority groups each had
over&#160;10,000&#160;members in&#160;2006. The largest groups were the South
Asians (298,370), Chinese (283,075) and Blacks (208,555).</p>
  <h4>2.1.1&#160;&#160;Geography of the city of Toronto</h4>
  <p>Toronto's residential population is not evenly distributed throughout
the city (Map <a href="m001-eng.htm" title="Map 1">1</a>).The highest residential concentration
is located close to the centre of the city, near Yonge and Bloor.Generally
speaking, the further the distance from this central point, the lower the
density.However, there are some high-density residential areas on the outskirts
of Toronto, particularly on Finch at Jane and Yonge and on both sides of the
Don Valley Parkway.The area surrounding the Don River (East and West branches)
in the city centre is a low-density zone.</p>
  <p></p>

    <div class="mapTitle">

    </div>
    <div class="clearbo"></div>
  </div>
  <p>The spatial distribution of jobs also shows high concentrations within
Toronto's city limits (Map <a href="m002-eng.htm" title="Map 2">2</a>).The highest densities
are near Yonge Street at the Sheppard and Eglinton intersections, but mostly
between Bloor and Front streets.More than&#160;100,000&#160;jobs in the finance
and insurance industry were situated in this cluster in&#160;2006. The other
workplace concentrations consisted of manufacturing clusters, shopping centres
or peripheral office clusters.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="clearbo"></div>
  </div>
  <p>The broad diversity of Toronto's population can be seen in the diversity
of the city's neighbourhoods. For example, the average individual income
of residents varies from one neighbourhood to another (Map <a href="m003-eng.htm" title="Map 3">3</a>). The neighbourhoods where the residents earn high incomes are situated
along three axes: that of the shore of Lake Ontario toward the east, that
of the Humber River in the west, and that of Yonge Street in the north. The
neighbourhoods where the average income of residents is lower are located
between the wealthier areas, along the Canadian National railway towards the
northeast and the northwest.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="clearbo"></div>
  </div>
  <p>In addition, visible minorities are proportionately more numerous on the
outskirts of Toronto (Map <a href="m004-eng.htm" title="Map 4">4</a>).The neighbourhoods in
the northeast part of the city house a large Chinese community.The Rexdale
neighbourhood in the northeast and the Malvern neighbourhood in the east are
home to high concentrations of South Asians, whileseveral Blacks live in the
vicinity of Jane, north of Eglinton.</p>

  <h3>2.2&#160;&#160;Police-reported crime in Toronto</h3>
  <p>Toronto is reputed to be one of the safest metropolitan areas in North
America (City of Toronto&#160;2009).Since&#160;1991, the crime rate in the
Toronto CMA has been below that of the country as a whole (Chart <a href="ct001-eng.htm" title="Chart 1">1</a>).Moreover, the rate has dropped by half since&#160;1991, down from&#160;9,330&#160;to&#160;4,461&#160;incidents
per&#160;100,000&#160;population.The crime rate in the Toronto CMA has remained
below that of the other two most populous CMAs in the country&#8212;Montr&#233;al
and Vancouver.</p>
  <div class="chart">
    <div class="chartNo">Chart 1</div>
    <div class="chartTitle">
      <a href="ct001-eng.htm">Crime rate in selected census metropolitan areas,&#160;1991&#160;to&#160;2007</a>
    </div>
    <div class="clearbo"></div>
  </div>
  <p>Although Toronto has a relatively low crime rate, it is important to understand
its crime patterns. With over&#160;143,000&#160;incidents reported in&#160;2006&#160;(excluding
traffic offences), Toronto still had the highest number of reported offences
in Canada.The number of homicide victims stood at&#160;79&#160;in&#160;2005,
the highest number since&#160;1991&#160;(86). The Toronto media coined&#160;2005&#160;"The
Year of the Gun" because of the significant percentage of homicides
committed with a firearm.This prompted the Government of Ontario to develop
a gun control strategy (Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario&#160;2008).</p>
  <p>The city of Toronto, which is the central municipality of the Toronto CMA
and the subject of this study, is served by the Toronto Police Service. Its
police-reported crime rate is higher than that of the other major police services
covering the Toronto CMA (Table <a href="t001-eng.htm" title="Table 1">1</a>). It has been
noted for several other Canadian cities that the crime rate is higher near
the centre of the city (Fitzgerald et al.&#160;2004; Wallace et al.&#160;2006;
Kitchen&#160;2006; Charron&#160;2008; Savoie&#160;2008a). However, given that
many non-residents come to Toronto to work or shop, the population used to
calculate crime rates in Toronto may be underestimated, which has inflated
the city's crime rate.</p>
  <div class="table">
    <div class="tableNo">Table  1</div>
    <div class="tableT">
      <a href="t001-eng.htm">Crime rates reported by selected police services,&#160;2006</a>
    </div>
    <div class="clearbo"></div>
  </div>
  <p>In&#160;2006, the crime rate in Toronto was generally lower than in two
of Canada's other major central cities&#8212;Montr&#233;al and Vancouver.
However, Toronto's homicide, assault and shoplifting rates were higher
than Montr&#233;al's and its rate of harassment was the highest of
the three central cities.Toronto's rate of property crime was below
the Canadian average, while its rate of violent crime was slightly above the
national average.</p>
  <h4>2.2.1&#160;&#160;Spatial distribution of violent crime in the city of Toronto</h4>
  <p>Crimes reported to the police are not randomly distributed throughout Toronto,
but are concentrated in certain areas.An examination of local crime rates
(the relationship between the number of crimes and the population at a local
level) shows that the rates of violent crime are higher near the downtown
core and in the east and northwest areas of the city (Map <a href="m005-eng.htm" title="Map 5">5</a>; See "Mapping techniques" in the Methodology section for
technical details.), which correspond roughly to the neighbourhoods along
the Canadian National railway and to the areas where residents earn the lowest
individual incomes (Map <a href="m003-eng.htm" title="Map 3">3</a>). There are some hot spots
within these areas that have higher rates.Some of these are Danforth, downtown
east side and the intersections of Lawrence and Morningside, Jane and Finch,
and Jane and Eglinton.</p>

  <p>In contrast, in the north area along Yonge Street, where residents earn
a higher income, the violent crime rate is much lower than average. The business
district&#8212;the Bay Street area where most of the workers in the finance
and insurance industry are employed&#8212;has a violent crime rate well below
the average for the city of Toronto. This differs from most of the other Canadian
cities that have been the focus of studies, where the violent crime rate in
the centre was high (Fitzgerald et al.&#160;2004; Wallace et al.&#160;2006;
Kitchen&#160;2006; Charron&#160;2008). A similar situation was noted in Montr&#233;al,
where the crime hot spots were spread out in many areas of the city (Savoie
et al.&#160;2006). The results suggest that the complex social geography of
large cities like Toronto and Montr&#233;al is related to the spatial organization
of crime.</p>
  <p>Toronto's neighbourhoods, when grouped according to violent crime
rates, show different characteristics (Table <a href="t002-eng.htm" title="Table 2">2</a>).The
categories in Map <a href="m005-eng.htm" title="Map 5">5</a> indicate that the rates for the
crime hot spots were&#160;18&#160;times higher than those of the cold spots.Since
these hot spots covered only a small area of the city of Toronto they only
accounted for&#160;2% of the city's crimes.</p>
  <p>Several neighbourhood characteristics vary according to the local police-reported
crime rate.Neighbourhoods with a high rate of violent crime are more densely
populated and have a higher percentage of residents living in multi-unit dwellings.They
also have the highest percentages of children (under the age of&#160;15),
renters, single-parent families and visible minorities.The residents of these
neighbourhoods are also less likely to have a university degree, more likely
to earn a lower wage, and more likely to live in low-income households.</p>

  <h4>2.2.2&#160;&#160;Spatial distribution of property crime in the city of Toronto</h4>
  <p>The property crime rate shows a significantly different distribution (Map&#160;6)
compared to violent crime rates. Property crime rates are very close to the
average for a large part of the city and are distributed more evenly.However,
certain hot spots are clearly evident and correspond to the city's major
shopping centres.Most of the smaller shopping centres represent secondary
clusters of property crime.</p>
  <div class="map">
    <div class="mapNo">Map 6</div>
    <div class="mapTitle">
      <a href="m006-eng.htm">Local property crime rates, city of Toronto,&#160;2006</a>
    </div>
    <div class="clearbo"></div>
  </div>
  <p>The neighbourhoods around the urban centre also show high property crime
rates.These are areas of high density and significant commercial activity.Low-crime
areas generally correspond to industrial areas or green spaces.</p>
  <p>An examination of neighbourhood characteristics by police-reported crime
rate supports the observations made from Map <a href="m006-eng.htm" title="Map 6">6</a>. It
can be seen that the density of commercial activity is proportional to the
local property crime rate (Table <a href="t003-eng.htm" title="Table 3">3</a>). As well,
there are more than five workers for every resident (5:1&#160;ratio) in the
property crime hot spots, likely due to the fact that the hot spots correspond
to shopping centres.</p>
  <div class="table">
    <div class="tableNo">Table  3</div>
    <div class="tableT">
      <a href="t003-eng.htm">Neighbourhood characteristics by property crime rate, city of Toronto,&#160;2006</a>
    </div>
    <div class="clearbo"></div>
  </div>
  <p>Property crime rates are also inversely proportional to the percentage
of manufacturing jobs.It can therefore be concluded that employment clusters
are only associated with this type of crime if they are related to commercial
activity. In other words, clusters of manufacturing and office jobs are not
linked to high property crime rates.</p>
  <p>The commercial nature of these property crime hot spots could explain why
several resident characteristics are similar to other areas in the city of
Toronto.For example, in&#160;2006&#160;the percentage of renters (39%) was
below the city average (46%), while the proportions of residents in low-income
households (18%) and single-parent families (14%) were the same as the average.</p>
  <p>Neighbourhoods where the property crime rates are close to the city average
have higher average employment incomes and a percentage of visible minorities
that is below the city average.Of all of the resident characteristics, only
the percentage of university graduates shows a linear relationship with property
crime rates. In neighbourhoods with low property crime rates, half of the
residents have a university degree, whereas this percentage drops to one third
in neighbourhoods with high property crime rates.High-property-crime neighbourhoods
also show higher bar density than the rest of the city.</p>
  <h3>2.3&#160;&#160;Crime rates and neighbourhood characteristics</h3>
  <p>Using the major crime categories (violent crime and property crime) analyzed
so far, a summary can be drawn of the spatial organization of crime in the
city of Toronto.It should be noted, however, that these are general outlines
and do not cover all of the finer points of the spatial distribution of specific
types of crime.Some of these details are examined in the section on the links
between neighbourhood characteristics and the rates of various types of crime.</p>
  <p>The statistical association between the rates of different types of crime
and certain neighbourhood characteristics is analysed using spatial regressions
(see "Multivariate regressions" in the Methodology section for
technical details).Maps showing the local rates of various types of police-reported
crime are included in the Appendix.</p>
  <h4>2.3.1&#160;&#160;Neighbourhood characteristics</h4>
  <p>Other studies have shown that many neighbourhood characteristics are linked
to crime (Fitzgerald et al.&#160;2004; Savoie et al.&#160;2006; Wallace et
al.&#160;2006; Kitchen&#160;2006; Andresen and Brantingham&#160;2007; Charron&#160;2008;
Savoie&#160;2008a; Savoie&#160;2008b).This study analyzes the statistical
association between police-reported crime rates and&#160;15&#160;neighbourhood
characteristics.All of these characteristics can be divided into five broad
categories: economic characteristics of residents; cultural characteristics
of residents; demographic characteristics of residents; urban characteristics
of neighbourhoods and economic activities of neighbourhoods (Table <a href="t004-eng.htm" title="Table 4">4</a>).</p>
  <div class="table">
    <div class="tableNo">Table  4</div>
    <div class="tableT">
      <a href="t004-eng.htm">Presentation of independent variables, city of Toronto census tracts,&#160;2006</a>
    </div>
    <div class="clearbo"></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Economic characteristics of neighbourhood residents</span>
  </p>
  <p>It is generally accepted that the lack of access to socio-economic resources
impedes the establishment of social control of crime by the resident population
(Forrest and Kearns&#160;2001; Sampson et al.&#160;2002). In addition, the
lack of integration into the economic system and the resulting stigmatization
compromise adherence to the behavioural norms held by society in general (Massey&#160;1996;
Body-Gendrot&#160;2001; Forrest and Kearns&#160;2001; Bauder&#160;2002; Sampson
et al.&#160;2002).</p>
  <p>Access to socio-economic resources is measured in part by a number of census
variables, each of these covering a specific aspect of disadvantage. For example,
the level of education provides a partial, indirect measure of an individual's
ability to find skilled employment, while average income gives a partial measure
of short term access to financial resources. There are some considerations
to note when using these variables. For example, financial resources also
depend on wealth and savings, and annual incomes are not guaranteed over the
long term.</p>
  <p>Because of the complexity of measuring socio-economic resources, several
variables can cover certain aspects of it. Since many of these variables are
strongly correlated, they cannot all be integrated into the multivariate analyses.
To resolve these problems, a factor analysis was used to derive two indicators
of access to socio-economic resources from the relevant census variables (see
"Variables" in the Methodology section for technical details).
Factor analyses enable us to identify the major patterns in a group of variables
and, in this case, to measure the extent of the socio-economic disadvantage
based on a group of variables.</p>
  <p>The first indicator (<span class="hp2">access to socio-economic resources</span>) derived
from the factor analysis covers the greater part of socio-economic resources.
The percentage of residents with a university degree, the percentage of residents
without a high school diploma, and the proportion of total income represented
by government transfers contribute significantly to the value of this indicator.
The average property value, the average personal income and the percentage
of residents in a lone-parent family are the other major contributors to this
indicator.Measured in this way, access to socio-economic resources results
in a sectional spatial configuration. The communities in the north and east
areas have greater access to socio-economic resources than do those in the
northeast and northwest areas.</p>
  <p>The second indicator (<span class="hp2">socio-economic vulnerability</span>) derived from
the factor analysis represents a different aspect of socio-economic resources.
The variables that contribute most are the unemployment rate and the percentage
of residents living in a low-income household. The communities with the greatest
socio-economic vulnerability are spread throughout the city with some of them
corresponding to public housing areas.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Cultural characteristics of neighbourhood residents</span>
  </p>
  <p>Several theories suggest that the ethno-cultural dimension of neighbourhoods
can be associated with local crime rates. In this study, three variables are
used to represent this dimension: the proportion of <span class="hp2">visible minorities,</span> the proportion of <span class="hp2">recent immigrants</span> and <span class="hp2">ethno-cultural diversity.</span></p>
  <p>A number of studies have focussed on the relationship between race and
crime, particularly in the United States (Felson et al.&#160;2008). It is
generally accepted that this association is particularly complex. In the United
States, a number of theories have been proposed to explain this association,
most referring to the historical effects of long years of discrimination and
segregation (Felson et al.&#160;2008). In Canada, several studies have shown
that the association between the percentage of members of a visible minority
or Aboriginal group and crime is explained essentially by other characteristics
of those neighbourhoods (Fitzgerald et al.&#160;2004; Savoie et al.&#160;2006;
Wallace et al.&#160;2006; Charron&#160;2008; Fitzgerald and Carrington&#160;2008;
Savoie&#160;2008a; Savoie&#160;2008b).</p>
  <p>Fewer studies have been done on the link between immigration and crime
than on the relationship between visible minority status (race) and crime
(Martinez&#160;2006). Most empirical research shows that if there is a relationship
between immigration and crime, it is an inverse one, that is, increased immigration
equates to less crime (Martinez&#160;2006). This can partially be explained
by the fact that recent immigrants tend to have a much higher level of education
than non-immigrants (Galarneau and Morissette&#160;2008). In this study, immigration
is measured as the proportion of neighbourhood residents who immigrated to
Canada between&#160;1997&#160;and&#160;2006.</p>
  <p>According to the foundational work of Shaw and MacKay (1942), a neighbourhood's
cultural heterogeneity is associated with crime to the extent that it is accompanied
by diversity in normative and linguistic terms that might inhibit community
cohesion (Elliot et al.&#160;1996). In this study, ethno-cultural diversity
is measured using an entropy index for visible minority groups. The entropy
index measures the diversity of groups in a census tract. If several groups
are present in large numbers, the index value is high (see "Variables"
in the Methodology section).</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Demographic characteristics of neighbourhood residents</span>
  </p>
  <p>At the individual level, the relationship between age and police-reported
crime has been clearly shown (Piquero et al&#160;2003; Matarazzo&#160;2005).
In the incidents that were geocoded for this study, children (under&#160;15&#160;years
of age) represented only&#160;6.2% of accused and&#160;10.1% of victims, while
they made up&#160;16.4% of the city of Toronto's total population. The
representation of people aged&#160;65&#160;and older in the data on crimes
reported to police was even lower. This group made up only&#160;1.7% of accused
and&#160;2.4% of victims, although it accounted for&#160;14.1% of the total
population. In contrast, young men aged&#160;20&#160;to&#160;29&#160;accounted
for&#160;20.8% of accused and&#160;14.6% of victims, while only representing&#160;7.0%
of the total population.</p>
  <p>Analyses of residential segregation show that neighbourhoods are distinguished
by the age of their residents (Davies and Murdie&#160;1993). It is therefore
important to verify if the demographic structure of neighbourhoods is related
to crime hot spots. Men are generally more likely than women to be involved
in criminal incidents, whether as victims or accused. However, since all neighbourhoods
usually have similar proportions of men and women among their residents, sex
is not strongly associated with crime at the neighbourhood level.</p>
  <p>In the city of Toronto, areas where <span class="hp2">children</span> (under&#160;15&#160;years
of age) are overrepresented are spread throughout the city in neighbourhoods
such as Jane-Finch and RegentPark. Neighbourhoods where <span class="hp2">elderly people</span> (65&#160;and older) are overrepresented are also widely dispersed, but
are in different locations, such as Westmount. As for <span class="hp2">young men</span> (aged&#160;20&#160;to&#160;29),
they are overrepresented in the downtown area and around YorkUniversity.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Urban characteristics of neighbourhoods</span>
  </p>
  <p>Since the pioneering work associated with the Chicago school (Simmel&#160;1903;
Park and Burgess&#160;1925; Shaw and McKay&#160;1942), the urban nature of
neighbourhoods has been linked to a particular way of life. Residents of inner
city neighbourhoods live in a busy environment where there is a high concentration
of individuals who are unknown to one another. Such conditions probably influence
social relationships, which become more anonymous and individualistic. By
impeding the development of strong social networks, of social cohesion&#160;<a href="fnpart-fnpartie1-eng.htm#fn2" title="Note 2"><sup>2</sup></a>&#160; in the neighbourhood (Sampson
and Morenoff,&#160;2004) and of attachment to one's neighbourhood, those
conditions might foster crime (Pain&#160;2000; Brown et al.&#160;2004).</p>
  <p>As mentioned, the city of Toronto's urban structure is complex; it
is not simply characterized by a decreasing density from downtown to the suburbs
(Map&#160;1&#160;and Map&#160;2). To take this complexity into account, two
urban characteristic indicators have been derived from a factor analysis (see
"Variables" in the Methodology section): <span class="hp2">centrality</span> and <span class="hp2">urbanization.</span></p>
  <p>Centrality is mainly characterized by ageing buildings and distance to
downtown (corner of Queen and Yonge streets). Thus, the degree of centrality
decreases gradually from downtown towards the outskirts.</p>
  <p>Neighbourhoods characterized by a high level of urbanization are dense,
have many apartment buildings but few single-detached houses, and include
dwellings with few rooms. Residents of those neighbourhoods are more likely
to be renters and to have moved during the last year, but less likely to have
been in the same place for five years or to drive to work. Highly urban neighbourhoods
are found in various areas including downtown, York University and Flemingdon
Park.</p>
  <p>Thus, urbanization and centrality represent different realities in Toronto.
Some neighbourhoods (such as Rosedale) might be central but not very urban,
while others might be on the outskirts and urban (such as Jane-Finch).</p>
  <p>According to the broken window theory, degradation of the physical environment
promotes crime (Kelling and Coles&#160;1998). The presence of graffiti, garbage
and run-down buildings might engender a sense of not caring, thus creating
an environment that favours crime (Brown et al.&#160;2004). No variable measures
degradation of the physical environment directly at the census tract level.
In this study, the proportion of dwellings requiring <span class="hp2">major repairs</span> is
used as an indirect measure. Such dwellings are overrepresented in the areas
located immediately to the northwest and the east of downtown, as well as
in certain other locations.</p>
  <p>As in many other large urban areas, in Toronto, the public transit system
greatly influences travel. The&#160;2006&#160;Census indicated that over a
third (34%) of Torontonians use public transit to get to work. Thus large
numbers of travelers flow through the many subway and train stations throughout
the city. To determine the possible impact of these transit areas on crime,
the presence of a <span class="hp2">subway or train station</span> was added as a dichotomous
variable in the multivariate models.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Economic activities of neighbourhoods</span>
  </p>
  <p>According to the crime opportunity theory (Cohen and Felson&#160;1979),
the concentration of business activity might favour crime since it brings
many opportunities for crime together in a single location. In this study, <span class="hp2">commercial activity</span> is measured by the number of retail trade, accommodation
and food service workers. In Toronto, business activity is concentrated in
a few clusters, including downtown and major shopping centers.</p>
  <p>Other employment clusters characterize Toronto's spatial structure.
To determine the impact of a neighbourhood's economic activity on crime, <span class="hp2">manufacturing jobs</span> and <span class="hp2">office jobs</span> are also taken into consideration.</p>
  <p>The role of bars in criminal activity has been examined in a number of
studies. These were based on the assumption that the presence of such establishments
might influence social standards in the neighbourhood (allowing more tolerance)
or might attract drinkers to a setting that favours violent crime (Treno et
al.&#160;2007). In this paper, <span class="hp2">bars</span> are measured by the number of workers
in beverage outlets in the census tract.</p>
  <h4>2.3.2&#160;&#160;Neighbourhood characteristics and local crime rates: Results</h4>
  <p>The following multiple regression results show the differences in local
rates of police-reported crime and how they relate to the neighbourhood characteristics
described above.&#160;<a href="fnpart-fnpartie1-eng.htm#fn3" title="Note 3"><sup>3</sup></a>&#160; The results identify the neighbourhood
characteristics that are more closely linked to crime rates after controlling
for other characteristics.</p>
  <p>Many regression models were used&#8212;one for each of the&#160;15&#160;types
of crimes analyzed. They are presented in five tables in order to allow comparisons
of the impact of neighbourhood characteristics on various types of crimes.
The results are examined after the tables are presented.</p>
  <p>It must be noted that the measure of crime used in this document (police-reported
crime) relies on statistical data from police forces, which include only crimes
reported to them that have been substantiated by a police investigation. Many
factors can influence the police-reported crime rate, including the willingness
of the public to report crimes to the police and changes in legislation, policies
or enforcement practices.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Economic activities of neighbourhoods violent crime and property crime</span>
  </p>
  <p>Map <a href="m005-eng.htm" title="Map 5">5</a> and Map <a href="m006-eng.htm" title="Map 6">6</a> show
that the spatial organization of violent crime rates differs from that of
property crime rates. The spatial regression model results (see "Multivariate
regressions" in the Methodology section) below allow a better understanding
of the differences (Table <a href="t005-eng.htm" title="Table 5">5</a> and Table <a href="t006-eng.htm" title="Table 6">6</a>).</p>

    </div>
    <div class="clearbo"></div>
  </div>
  <p>The statistical association between violent and property crime rates and
various neighbourhood characteristics is analyzed based on two sets of independent
variables.</p>
  <p>In the first set (indicators, Table <a href="t005-eng.htm" title="Table 5">5</a>), the
socio-economic characteristics of residents and the urban characteristics
of neighbourhoods are represented by the variables described above, access
to socio-economic resources, economic vulnerability, centrality and urbanization.
These variables are indicators derived from factor analyses and are more closely
related to the major theories on links between crime and neighbourhood characteristics.</p>
  <p>The second set of variables (all variables, Table <a href="t006-eng.htm" title="Table 6">6</a>) does not include indicators that represent the concepts in environmental
criminology theories but rather the set of&#160;19&#160;variables that make
up the four indicators (see "Factor analysis" in the Methodology
section). These models thus include&#160;31&#160;independent variables. Similar
to those used in earlier studies (Savoie et al.&#160;2006; Wallace et al.&#160;2006;
Savoie&#160;2008a), they are included for purposes of comparison with the
results obtained for those cities.</p>
  <p>The two models that include socio-economic and urban characteristic indicators
(Table <a href="t005-eng.htm" title="Table 5">5</a>) account for half of the variation in
the police-reported crime rates. However, they display different structures.
For example, dwellings requiring major repairs and economic vulnerability
are associated with violent crime, while centrality is associated only with
property crime.</p>
  <p>Several neighbourhood characteristics are associated with the two types
of crime but in different proportions. For example, commercial activity is
the characteristic most strongly associated with property crime rates, while
access to socio-economic resources is more closely related to violent crime
rates. Also, urbanization is more strongly associated with violent crime than
with property crime.</p>
  <p>Finally, the two categories of crime are inversely proportional to the
number of manufacturing jobs and office jobs, but their rates are higher in
neighbourhoods where subways or train stations are located.</p>
  <p>The two types of regression models (with socio-economic and urban characteristic
indicators or with the set of all variables) produce comparable results. In
fact, it seems that certain variables explain crime rates about as well as
the indicators: the proportion of lone-parent families for access to socio-economic
resources, and the age of buildings for centrality.</p>
  <p>The exact impact of each neighbourhood characteristic may, however, vary
according to the set of independent variables. For example, the 'bars'
variable is significant only in the models that include all variables. Despite
small differences such as these, the results that were obtained through the
models using indicators and the models using all independent variables were
similar.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Various types of violent crime</span>
  </p>
  <p>Access to socio-economic resources is closely related to all types of violent
crime, particularly uttering threats and major assault (Table <a href="t007-eng.htm" title="Table 7">7</a>). The other neighbourhood characteristics, however, differ in their
association with the various types of police-reported violent crime. For example,
economic vulnerability is associated with sexual assault, uttering threats,
major assault and robbery, but not with harassment and common assault.</p>
  <div class="table">
    <div class="tableNo">Table  7</div>
    <div class="tableT">

    </div>
    <div class="clearbo"></div>
  </div>
  <p>The percentage of recent immigrants is inversely proportional to all types
of violent crime. It should also be noted that ethno-cultural diversity is
associated only with sexual assault.</p>
  <p>As for demographic characteristics, rates of harassment and common assault
increase with the proportion of children (under&#160;15) and of young men
(aged&#160;20&#160;to&#160;29). Rates of sexual assaults, threats, major assaults
and robberies decrease as the proportion of people aged&#160;65&#160;and older
increases.</p>
  <p>All rates (with the exception of the robbery rate) are higher in more urban
neighbourhoods, while none of the rates are higher in more central neighbourhoods.
All rates (with the exception of the sexual assault rate) are higher in neighbourhoods
with a high proportion of dwellings requiring major repairs, while the rates
of sexual assaults and robberies are higher in neighbourhoods where there
is a subway or train station.</p>
  <p>Finally, assault and robbery rates increase with commercial activity. Rates
of sexual assault, common assault and robbery are lower in areas where there
are high concentrations of office workers.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Various types of theft</span>
  </p>
  <p>Unlike the various types of violent crime, which are all more or less associated
with the same neighbourhood characteristics, the rates of various types of
police-reported theft show very different spatial structures (Table <a href="t008-eng.htm" title="Table 8">8</a>).</p>
  <div class="table">
    <div class="tableNo">Table  8</div>

    </div>
    <div class="clearbo"></div>
  </div>
  <p>Shoplifting is strongly associated with the neighbourhood's economic activity.
Its rates are higher where commercial activity is high. However, shoplifting
rates are lower in areas with high concentrations of manufacturing jobs, in
neighbourhoods where there is a higher concentration of bars, and where residents
have greater access to socio-economic resources.</p>
  <p>Rates of theft from a motor vehicle are higher in neighbourhoods with a
greater number of bars and in central and urban neighbourhoods. These rates
are lower in neighbourhoods with higher proportions of older residents (65&#160;and
over).</p>
  <p>Motor vehicle theft rates are higher in neighbourhoods with higher proportions
of children (under&#160;15) and young men aged&#160;20&#160;to&#160;29. They
are also higher in neighbourhoods where access to socio-economic resources
is limited or where there is a subway or train station, as well as in clusters
of commercial and manufacturing activity.</p>
  <p>Finally, other thefts vary according to several neighbourhood characteristics,
mainly commercial activity and the proportion of recent immigrants.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Breaking and entering, mischief and drug offences</span>
  </p>
  <p>The spatial structure of breaking and entering varies essentially with
urban and economic activity characteristics. More specifically, results show
that breaking and entering is relatively more frequent in central neighbourhoods,
with high commercial activity, but less so in areas with high numbers of office
jobs (Table <a href="t009-eng.htm" title="Table 9">9</a>).</p>

  </div>
  <p>Mischief and drug offences are more dependant on access to socio-economic
resources, a low proportion of recent immigrants and elderly people, centrality
and commercial activity. Mischief also occurs more frequently where there
are dwellings requiring major repairs, while drug offences are more common
in more urban and ethno-culturally diverse neighbourhoods.</p>
  <h4>2.3.3&#160;&#160;Neighbourhood characteristics and local crime rates: Analysis of results</h4>
  <p>The results presented above are interpreted and summarized below in five
sections, one for each category of neighbourhood characteristics.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Socio-economic characteristics of neighbourhood residents</span>
  </p>
  <p>Generally speaking, residents' socio-economic characteristics are
more closely associated with violent crime rates, however, access to socio-economic
resources is more strongly linked to crime rates than economic vulnerability.</p>
  <p>Uttering threats, major assault and drug offences showed the closest association
with access to socio-economic resources. Other strong links were noted for
mischief, motor vehicle theft, robbery, sexual assault and common assault.
Only other thefts (which exclude shoplifting, theft from a motor vehicle and
motor vehicle theft) and breaking and entering were not significantly associated
with access to socio-economic resources.</p>
  <p>Economic vulnerability was associated with generally serious violent crimes:
robbery, major assault, sexual assault and uttering threats. It was not related
to common assault, harassment or any type of property crime.</p>
  <p>These findings tend to support the results from studies of other Canadian
cities (Fitzgerald et al.&#160;2004; Savoie et al.&#160;2006; Wallace et al.&#160;2006;
Kitchen&#160;2006; Andresen and Brantingham&#160;2007; Charron&#160;2008;
Savoie&#160;2008a; Savoie&#160;2008b). Access to socio-economic resources
seems to be one of the neighbourhood characteristics most closely associated
with crime rates. In Toronto, it is more closely linked to violent crime than
property crime. The nature of the data used in this report does not allow
us to directly link crime rates and the socio-economic characteristics of
neighbourhood residents. However, the results do not contradict theories that
social cohesion, which would be measured indirectly by access to socio-economic
resources, favours social control of crime by the local community (Forrest
and Kearns&#160;2001; Sampson et al.&#160;2002).</p>
  <p>Moreover, results suggest that the economic vulnerability of a neighbourhood's
residents, combined with limited access to socio-economic resources, can create
a setting that is conducive to the perpetration of violent crimes such as
serious assault, robbery and sexual assault. These results are consistent
with theories that failure to integrate into the economic system leads to
a lack of respect for the standards of behaviour endorsed by society in general
(Massey&#160;1996; Body-Gendrot&#160;2001; Forrest and Kearns&#160;2001; Bauder&#160;2002;
Sampson et al.&#160;2002).</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Cultural characteristics of neighbourhood residents</span>
  </p>
  <p>On the whole, it seems that if cultural characteristics are significantly
associated with police-reported crime rates, they tend to decrease them. The
higher the proportion of recent immigrants in a neighbourhood, the lower the
rates of drug offences, all types of violent crime, mischief and other thefts.
These results are in line with those of most international studies (Martinez&#160;2006).</p>
  <p>Thus, all else being equal, high-immigration neighbourhoods generally have
lower crime rates. Excluding other thefts, the types of crimes that are strongly
linked to recent immigration are also associated with access to socio-economic
resources. Thus, the relationship between recent immigration and crime seems
to complement the link mentioned above between access to socio-economic resources
and crime.</p>
  <p>In other words, given two neighbourhoods where residents have comparable
access to socio-economic resources, the one with a higher proportion of recent
immigrants is likely to have a lower crime rate (Table <a href="t010-eng.htm" title="Table 10">10</a>). When socio-economic resources are not taken into account, neighbourhoods
with a proportion of recent immigrants that is higher than the city's
average have a slightly higher violent crime rate (6.65) than other neighbourhoods
(6.31). This difference, however, is small, if we compare it with the gap
between neighbourhoods whose residents have a higher than average access to
socio-economic resources (4.87) and other neighbourhoods (8.19). However,
when the comparison is made between neighbourhoods where residents have similar
access to socio-economic resources, high-immigration neighbourhoods have lower
violent crime rates than other neighbourhoods.</p>
  <div class="table">
    <div class="tableNo">Table  10</div>
    <div class="tableT">
      <a href="t010-eng.htm">Violent crime rates (per&#160;1,000&#160;residents and workers), by immigration and access to socio-economic resources, city of Toronto neighbourhoods,&#160;2006</a>
    </div>
    <div class="clearbo"></div>
  </div>
  <p>Many theories can explain why neighbourhoods with higher proportions of
recent immigrants have lower crime rates.</p>
  <p>The average income of recent immigrants in the city of Toronto ($24,679)
is considerably lower than that of other residents ($48,141). This financial
situation causes many of them to live in neighbourhoods where access to socio-economic
resources is limited and violent crime rates are high. Despite their lower
incomes, more recent immigrants in the city of Toronto hold a university degree
(56%) than other residents (45%), which is also true for Canada as a whole
(Galarneau and Morissette&#160;2008). This high level of education is in contrast
to that of many other residents of those neighbourhoods.</p>
  <p>Thus, the level of education of recent immigrants seems to have a protective
effect on crime in neighbourhoods that are disadvantaged from a socio-economic
point of view. Moreover, some authors have theorized that the arrival of immigrants
in certain disadvantaged neighbourhoods might encourage the development of
new forms of social organization and community revitalization (Martinez&#160;2006).</p>
  <p>Neighbourhood ethno-cultural diversity is associated with rates of three
types of crimes only (at lower significance thresholds): sexual assault, other
thefts and drug offences.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Demographic characteristics of neighbourhood residents</span>
  </p>
  <p>In comparison with socio-economic and cultural characteristics, demographic
characteristics of residents are only slightly associated with crime in Toronto's
neighbourhoods.</p>
  <p>Rates for most types of crime are lower where there are higher proportions
of elderly people. These associations perhaps reflect the fact that most people
aged&#160;65&#160;and older are more likely to be home at any given time of
day, and thus informally watch over the neighbourhood. As for the proportions
of children under&#160;15&#160;and of young men aged&#160;20&#160;to&#160;29&#160;who
live in the neighbourhood, they are associated with motor vehicle theft, common
assault and harassment rates.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Urban characteristics of neighbourhoods</span>
  </p>
  <p>The spatial organization of several types of police-reported crime is linked
to urban characteristics. In general, the results show that violent crime
rates are more closely associated with urbanization, while property crime
rates are more related to centrality. In fact, urban neighbourhoods (dense
neighbourhoods with renter residents who move often) show high rates of all
types of violent offences, with the exception of robberies. Central neighbourhoods
(those close to downtown with old buildings) show high rates of mischief,
breaking and entering and theft from a motor vehicle. Drug offence rates are
associated with both urbanization and centrality.</p>
  <p>Although they coincide in most medium-size cities, centrality and urbanization
show different spatial configurations in Toronto. By examining them separately,
the complex relationships between crime and neighbourhood characteristics
can be better understood.</p>
  <p>Central neighbourhoods are the most accessible of the entire city. Many
transportation routes converge there, particularly public transit routes.
Because of this accessibility, central areas are important centers of commerce.
The downtown area is characterized both by its commercial activities and its
financial district. Thousands of workers, students, consumers and tourists
pass through there. Central neighbourhoods are therefore accessible and familiar,
points of reference that many residents of the urban area know well. Building
age is associated with distance to downtown since city growth occurs concentrically
with new dwellings being built ever further from the historic center.</p>
  <p>Some research suggests that accessibility brings together numerous crime
opportunities, potential victims and properties that may be at risk of theft
or damage. Because they are relatively accessible to the residents of the
urban area (including perpetrators of crime), central neighbourhoods are more
likely to be the location of criminal activity (Bernasco and Luykx&#160;2003).
In addition, the familiarity of central neighbourhoods makes them more vulnerable
to potential thieves, who have a better knowledge of the physical environment
(including escape paths) and of the residents' and workers' routines
(Bernasco and Luykx&#160;2003).</p>
  <p>Finally, since numerous people travel through central neighbourhoods every
day, these areas provide an anonymous setting that might be favourable to
crime. Residents of central neighbourhoods might know their immediate neighbours,
but they will not recognize everyone that passes by. For example, the anonymity
provided by the city-centre in Montr&#233;al makes many passers-by indifferent
to victimisation incidents they could witness (Paquin&#160;2006). The accessibility,
familiarity and anonymity of central neighbourhoods may provide an environment
favourable to mischief, breaking and entering, and theft from a vehicle.</p>
  <p>Urban neighbourhoods provide an environment characterized by its density
and its apartment buildings, and are inhabited by renters who may not reside
at the same address for an extended period. Those conditions do not favour
the development of cohesive local communities able to exert social control
over behaviour, particularly criminal behaviour (Sampson and Morenoff&#160;2004).
Moreover, the high residential mobility and the fact of being renters may
limit people's attachment to their places of residence and neighbourhoods
(Pain&#160;2000; Brown et al.&#160;2004).</p>
  <p>As an indirect measure of the state of degradation of a neighbourhood's
physical environment, the proportion of dwellings requiring major repairs
is associated with the rates of all types of violent offences (except sexual
assaults), mischief, motor vehicle theft and other thefts. Degradation of
the physical environment might give the impression of ambivalence and might
reflect local community disorganization (Brown et al.&#160;2004).</p>
  <p>Mischief rates are also higher near subway and train stations, as are rates
of sexual assault, motor vehicle theft and robbery. These results perhaps
reflect the fact that subway and train stations are busy places where crimes
might go unnoticed. Because subway and train stations are means of access
to the public transit system, many transit users tend to park their cars in
the vicinity, which can increase motor vehicle theft opportunities.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Economic activities of neighbourhoods</span>
  </p>
  <p>Neighbourhoods' economic activities are associated with several types
of crimes but, overall, they are more closely related to property crimes.
In fact, a strong statistical association between property crime rates and
commercial activity was noted in many other Canadian cities (Savoie&#160;2008b).
That is the case with commercial activity, which is very strongly linked to
shoplifting, other thefts and, to a lesser degree, breaking and entering and
motor vehicle theft.</p>
  <p>By definition, shoplifting offences are associated with high commercial
activity. Among commercial clusters, those that are not located in manufacturing
areas show higher crime rates. That finding might be related to differences
in the nature of the commercial activity. For example, businesses located
in manufacturing areas are of the big-box type, which might affect shoplifting
rates.</p>
  <p>The association between commercial activity and motor vehicle theft probably
reflects the fact that, by attracting consumers, commercial activity concentrates
many vehicles in parking lots, which sometimes favours motor vehicle theft.
There are also sometimes large parking lots at subway or train stations and
in clusters of manufacturing jobs.</p>
  <p>Several other types of crimes are also related to business activity: robbery,
drug offences and assault (common and major). These associations likely reflect
the fact that commercial activities attract many people to the same place,
thus providing numerous opportunities for crime. In some way, commercial activities
create an environment of intense human activity, an anonymous and impersonal
environment that offers certain similarities with centrality.</p>
  <p>Finally, all other things being equal, the presence of bars is not associated
with crime, with the exception of theft from a vehicle. Given the aggregated
nature of the data, no direct link can be made between bar customers and those
thefts. Nevertheless, this association perhaps has to do with a particular
environment in neighbourhoods with many bars, an environment that might favour
the perpetration of these types of crimes (Felson et al.&#160;2008).</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Adjacent neighbourhoods</span>
  </p>
  <p>Spatial regressions allow us to take certain information on the relationships
between crime and neighbourhood characteristics into consideration. Mainly,
spatial error and spatial lag variables account for territorial situations
that cross over census tract boundaries. For example, crime observed in a
census tract might be influenced by crime in adjacent census tracts or by
their characteristics. More information on this technique is provided in "Spatial
autocorrelation and regression" in the Methodology section.</p>
  <p>Results show that shoplifting is not affected by adjacent neighbourhoods.&#160;<a href="fnpart-fnpartie1-eng.htm#fn4" title="Note 4"><sup>4</sup></a>&#160; That
result, which was also observed in Saskatoon (Charron&#160;2008), probably
reflects the fact that the location of shoplifting hot spots depends solely
on the characteristics of business clusters and not on those of adjacent neighbourhoods.</p>
  <p>Hot spots for other types of crimes are associated with adjacent neighbourhood
characteristics. They cover several adjacent census tracts, and the characteristics
of those neighbourhoods do not account for each of these spatial structures.
These structures might reflect the fact that such crimes are committed by
a small number of people who operate mainly in those hot spots. They are perhaps
also associated with local crime cultures, in places where certain types of
crime would be reported differently to the police.</p>

  <h2 id="h2_3" class="RGB">3 &#160;&#160;Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The spatial analysis of crime in the city of Toronto illustrates the complex
links between police-reported crime and neighbourhood characteristics. Results
from this analysis have shown that certain neighbourhood characteristics are
related to higher or lower crime rates.</p>
  <p>Violent crime rates have been found to be more concentrated in neighbourhoods
whose residents have a limited access to socioeconomic resources. Maps show
that the spatial organization of violent crime rates (Map <a href="m005-eng.htm" title="Map 5">5</a>) closely matches residential organization based on income (Map <a href="m003-eng.htm" title="Map 3">3</a>). Violent crime rates are also higher in more "urban"
neighbourhoods, i.e. neighbourhoods with higher population densities and higher
residential mobility.</p>
  <p>These results are consistent with previous research studies that have found
that a lack of access to socio-economic resources and the "urban"
character of neighbourhoods impede social control of crime by limiting social
cohesion and sense of belonging (Forrest and Kearns&#160;2001; Sampson et
al.&#160;2002; Pain&#160;2000; Brown et al.&#160;2004).</p>
  <p>Property crime rates have been found to be associated with the economic
activities of neighbourhoods: they are higher in areas with high commercial
activity (such as shopping centres). Their rates are also generally higher
in neighbourhoods that are close to the city centre.</p>
  <p>Conversely, crime rates are generally lower in neighbourhoods with higher
proportions of elderly residents and recent immigrants. Since Toronto has
a large number of recent immigrants and will probably continue to attract
immigrants (B&#233;langer and Caron-Malenfant&#160;2005) and given the aging
of the population, further studies are required to better understand the "protective"
effect of the proportion of recent immigrants and elderly people on crime.</p>
  <p>The analyses in this study compared police-reported crime statistics with
neighbourhood characteristics for&#160;2006. The analyses have shed light
on the spatial correspondence between crime and neighbourhoods, but have not
provided a description of the complex mechanisms underlying this spatial correspondence.
For example, it is not known if reduced access to socio-economic resources
in a specific neighbourhood precedes an increase in the crime rate or if it
is the increase in crime that leads residents with greater access to socio-economic
resources to relocate to lower crime neighbourhoods.</p>
  <p>To address such questions, it would be useful to analyse the data over
a period of time. By evaluating both spatial correspondence and time synchronization,
such analyses would allow us to better understand the complex mechanisms that
are related to higher or lower crime rates across city neighbourhoods.</p>

  <h3>4.1&#160;&#160;Data sources</h3>
  <h4>4.1.1&#160;&#160;Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey</h4>
  <p>The Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) collects detailed
information on individual criminal incidents reported to the police, including
incident, accused and victim characteristics.</p>
  <p>The UCR2&#160;Survey allows a maximum of four offences per criminal incident
to be recorded in the database. The selected offences are classified according
to their level of seriousness, which is related to the maximum sentence that
can be imposed under the <span class="hp1">Criminal Code</span>.</p>
  <p>The major offence categories (violent offences and property offences) are
based on the most serious offence in each incident, as are the crime rates
published annually by the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics (CCJS). In
this type of classification, a higher priority is given to violent offences
than to property offences. As a result, less serious offences may be under-represented
when only the most serious offence is considered.</p>
  <p>When the analysis is on individual offence types, all incidents in which
the offence is reported are included, whatever the seriousness or the ranking
of the offence in the incident. In this study, this includes incidents of
sexual assault, criminal harassment, uttering threats, assault (common and
major), robbery, shoplifting, motor vehicle theft, theft from a motor vehicle,
other thefts, breaking and entering, mischief and drug offences. This method
provides a more complete spatial representation of the different types of
individual offences.</p>
  <p>This report includes most <span class="hp1">Criminal Code</span> offences and all offences
under the <span class="hp1">Controlled Drug and Substances Act</span>, but it excludes offences
under other federal and provincial statutes and municipal by-laws. Also excluded
are <span class="hp1">Criminal Code</span> offences for which there is either no expected pattern
of spatial distribution or a lack of information about the actual location
of the offence. For example, administrative offences, including bail violations,
failure to appear and breaches of probation, are typically reported at court
locations. Also, threatening or harassing phone calls are often reported at
the receiving end of the call and impaired driving offences may be more likely
to be related to the location of apprehension (for example, apprehensions
resulting from roadside stop programs).</p>
  <h4>4.1.2&#160;&#160;Census of Population</h4>
  <p>The Census of Population provides the population, dwelling and workplace
counts not only for Canada as a whole, but also for each province and territory,
and for smaller geographic units, such as cities or districts within cities.
The census also provides information about Canada's demographic, social
and economic characteristics.</p>
  <p>The detailed socio-economic data used in this report are derived from the
long form of the census, which is completed by a&#160;20% sample of households.
The Census of Population is conducted by Statistics Canada every five years,
and was last carried out in&#160;2006.</p>
  <h3>4.2&#160;&#160;Geocoding</h3>
  <p>Geocoding is the process that is used to match a particular address with
a geographic location on the earth's surface. In this report, an address
corresponds to the location of an incident that was reported to the police,
after aggregation to the block-face level&#8212; that is, to one side of a
city block between two consecutive intersections. This is done by matching
records in two databases, one containing a list of addresses, the other containing
information about the street network and the address range within a given
block. The geocoding tool will match the address with its unique position
in the street network. As the street network is geo-referenced (located in
geographic space with reference to a co-ordinate system), it is possible to
generate longitude and latitude values&#8212;or X and Y values&#8212;for each
criminal incident. Where the incident location does not correspond to an address,
geocoding is performed by creating a point on, say, an intersection of two
streets or the middle of a public park. X and Y values in the criminal incident
database provide the spatial components that allows points to be mapped, relative
to the street or neighbourhood in which the incidents occurred.</p>
  <p>For the purposes of this report, the Toronto Police Service sent to the
CCJS the addresses of the incidents selected, reported and entered in the
UCR2&#160;database in&#160;2006. This information was resolved by the CCJS
into a set of geographical co-ordinates (X and Y) for each address. These
co-ordinates were rolled up to the mid-point of a block-face in the case of
specific addresses, and to intersection points in the case of streets and
parks.</p>
  <p>The Toronto Police Service provided information on&#160;119,259&#160;selected
incidents for&#160;2006. Through geocoding&#160;106,175&#160;of them (89%)
were located. Some incidents could not be geocoded because they were linked
to more than one address (6,739). The remaining incidents (6,345) either contained
information that was too vague or were located outside the city of Toronto's
boundaries.</p>
  <p>The low percentage of incidents that failed geocoding did not create a
bias in offence trends. In fact, geocoded offences and offences prior to geocoding
both account for the same proportion of overall crime.</p>
  <h3>4.3&#160;&#160;Mapping techniques</h3>
  <p>Kernel analysis is a method for representing the spatial distribution of
crime data. This method makes it possible to examine criminal incident point
data across neighbourhood boundaries and to identify areas where these incidents
are concentrated. The goal of kernel analysis is to estimate, based on a point
pattern, how the density of events varies across a study area. Kernel analysis
produces a smooth map of density values.</p>
  <p>In kernel estimation, a fine grid is overlaid on the study area. Distances
are measured from the centre of a grid cell to each observation that falls
within a predefined region of influence known as a bandwidth. Each observation
contributes to the density value of that grid cell based on its distance from
the centre of the cell. Nearby observations are given more weight in the density
calculation than those that are farther away. The product of the kernel estimation
method is a matrix (raster image) displaying local density values. In this
study, the grid cell size is&#160;100&#160;square metres and the research
radius used is&#160;1,000&#160;metres. This method of analysis was applied
using the kernel density tool available in the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst extension.</p>
  <p>Density matrices were produced for the different types of crimes examined
in this study and for the population at risk (residential and working population
in each census block). Crimes rates were produced by dividing, for each cell,
the crime density value by the population at risk density value. For each
type of offence, the categories were defined as follows: less than one third
of the average rate; from one third to one half of the average rate; from
one half to two thirds of the average rate; from two thirds of the average
rate to&#160;1.33&#160;times the average rate; from&#160;1.33&#160;times the
average rate to twice the average rate; from twice to three times the average
rate; and more than three times the average rate.</p>
  <h3>4.4&#160;&#160;Variables</h3>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Crime rate:</span> For the purposes of this study, the crime rate represents
the number of incidents per&#160;1,000&#160;residents and workers. Crime data
are from the&#160;2006&#160;Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey,
while data on the number of residents and workers are derived from the&#160;2006&#160;Census
of Population. For each type of crime, all incidents that include at least
one offence of that type are counted. For example, an incident that includes
one mischief violation and one common assault violation will be counted in
both the mischief rate and the assault rate. The property crime rate is the
only exception. In that case, only incidents that include at least one property
offence, but that do not include a violent offence are counted.</p>

    <span class="hp2">Visible minorities:</span> Percentage of residents in a census tract who
indicated they were members of a visible minority. Under the <span class="hp1">Employment
Equity Act,</span> members of visible minorities are "persons, other than
aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Recent immigrants:</span> Percentage of residents in a census tract who
immigrated to Canada between&#160;1997&#160;and&#160;2006.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="hp2">Ethno-cultural diversity:</span>Value of the Shannon diversity index for
visible minority groups in a census tract. The entropy index measures the
diversity of the groups in a census tract as calculated using the following
equation:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="i001-eng.htm">Figure 1</a>
  </p>
  <p>where <span class="hp2">i</span> is the census tract, <span class="hp2">S</span> the number of visible minority
groups (11, including the group of non-members of a visible minority group)
and <span class="hp2">pi</span> the proportion of the population represented by the group in
the census tract. If all the groups are found in equal proportions in a census
tract, the diversity index has a maximum value&#160;2.39, since in this case,
there are&#160;11&#160;groups. If one group is particularly dominant in terms
of its number of members in the census tract, the value of the index will
approach&#160;0.</p>
  <p>Visible minority groups were selected to measure ethno-cultural diversity
since they are less numerous and more clearly defined than groups based on
ethnic origin.</p>

Census Day. Crime statistics show that young men aged&#160;15&#160;to&#160;24&#160;are
more likely to be victims of crime (Gannon and Mihorean&#160;2005) or to be
accused of criminal acts (see the "Neighbourhood characteristics"
section of the report). However, the spatial distribution of young men aged&#160;15&#160;to&#160;19&#160;is
very similar to that for children aged&#160;15&#160;and under, both groups
being overrepresented in the same family-oriented and residential census tracts.
An exploration of the data showed, however, that young men aged&#160;20&#160;to&#160;29&#160;had
a particular spatial distribution that was associated with crime rates in
a different way.</p>

  <h4>4.4.1&#160;&#160;Factor analysis</h4>
  <p>Factor analysis is used to reveal latent characteristics (i.e. those that
are not measured directly) using variables with which they might be associated.
With this method, variables that are strongly correlated contribute more to
the definition of certain factors. These contributions make it possible to
determine the importance of each factor in a census tract (see "Spatial
analysis units" in the Methodology section) by calculating a factor
score. The factor score becomes the neighbourhood characteristic that is used
in a multivariate regression model.</p>
  <p>In this study, factor analyses are used to define the main spatial structures
contained in the socio-economic and urban characteristic variables. As previously
mentioned, several census variables only partially and imperfectly account
for the socio-economic and urban realities of neighbourhoods. Factor scores
represent the major spatial trends common to the variables used in the factor
analyses and are thus indicators of the various socio-economic and urban aspects
of census tracts.</p>
  <p>The factor analyses were produced using SPSS software. It was preferred
over the principal components analysis in order to reveal latent factors (Costello
and Osborne&#160;2005). Since certain variables did not have normal distributions,
the selected extraction method was that of the principal axis factors. Lastly,
direct oblimin rotation was applied to clarify the factor structure while
allowing the factors to be partially correlated, which corresponds more closely
to the phenomena observed in the social sciences (Costello and Osborne&#160;2005).</p>
  <p>The purpose of the first factor analysis performed in this study was to
identify the main spatial structures of socio-economic inequalities among
neighbourhoods. Nine variables were included in the analysis: the average
property value, the average income of residents,&#160;<a href="fnpart-fnpartie1-eng.htm#fn5" title="Note 5"><sup>5</sup></a>&#160; the
proportion of residents&#160;<a href="fnpart-fnpartie1-eng.htm#fn6" title="Note 6"><sup>6</sup></a>&#160; with a university degree, the proportion
of residents who did not finish high school, the proportion of part-time workers,
the proportion of total income from government transfers, the unemployment
rate, the proportion of residents in single-parent families, and the proportion
of residents in low-income households.</p>
  <p>The results show two major attributes (Table <a href="t011-eng.htm" title="Table 11">11</a>).
Access to socio-economic resources distinguishes census tracts based on their
property values, the average employment income of their residents, the proportion
of total income from government transfers, the proportion of single-parent
families and the proportion of low-income households but, particularly, based
on their residents' level of education. Economic vulnerability distinguishes
census tracts mainly based on the proportion of low-income households and
on unemployment rates.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="clearbo"></div>
  </div>
  <p>The goal of the second factor analysis was to show the main urban differences
among neighbourhoods. Ten variables were included in the analysis: the average
number of rooms per dwelling, the proportion of single-detached houses, the
proportion of apartment buildings, the residential density, the proportion
of residents who moved in the previous year, the proportion of residents who
did not change their address in the previous five years, the proportion of
residents who drive to work, the distance to downtown and the average building
age.&#160;<a href="fnpart-fnpartie1-eng.htm#fn7" title="Note 7"><sup>7</sup></a>&#160; The proportion
of dwellings requiring repairs was not used in the analysis because its link
to crime night be considered of a different order (Kelling and Coles&#160;1998)
and thus it is more advisable to keep it as an independent variable.</p>
  <p>The results show two major dimensions (Table <a href="t012-eng.htm" title="Table 12">12</a>).
Urbanization distinguishes census tracts by the number of rooms per dwelling,
the proportion of renters, dwelling type, density, residential mobility and
driving to work. Centrality distinguishes census tracts mainly based on distance
to downtown and on building age.</p>

  <h4>4.4.2&#160;&#160;Coefficients of correlation for independent variables</h4>
  <p>Several pairs of independent variables show significant coefficients of
correlation (Table <a href="t012-eng.htm" title="Table 12">12</a>). This finding confirms
the fact that the neighbourhood characteristics suspected of being associated
with crime are also interrelated. It also shows that cities are complex organisms,
within which many factors interact with each other.</p>
  <p>For example, the associations among socio-economic variables and ethno-cultural
variables indicate that recent immigrants and visible minorities tend to live
in socio-economically disadvantaged census tracts. Also, the coefficients
in Table <a href="t013-eng.htm" title="Table 13">13</a> indicate that young men are overrepresented
in downtown neighbourhoods while children and the elderly are overrepresented
on the outskirts.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The significant correlations noted among the independent variables raise
certain considerations of a technical nature. When correlations among independent
variables are large (i.e. if there is multicollinearity), regression model
results can be misleading. In this study,&#160;15&#160;variables were selected
since it could be expected that the phenomena they represent have specific
relationships with crime. Strongly correlated variables representing the same
theoretical relationship with crime were grouped together by the factor analyses
described above.</p>
  <p>However, the proportion of visible minorities was excluded from the analysis
because it was too strongly correlated with economic characteristics and other
cultural characteristics of neighbourhood residents. In the regression models
in this paper, all independent variables had variance inflation factors lower
than&#160;5, which means that collinearity is not a very significant issue
in this data set.</p>
  <h3>4.5&#160;&#160;Multivariate regressions</h3>
  <p>The backward method was used to determine the variables included in the
models. The small number of incidents for some types of offences (such as
sexual assault, criminal harassment and drug offences) could have caused some
problems because of the large number of observations with a null rate. However,
since the residuals from these models had a near-normal distribution, this
had no effect on the models.</p>
  <h4>4.5.1&#160;&#160;Spatial analysis units</h4>
  <p>Ecological studies like those conducted in crime cartography projects require
enough geographic units or neighbourhoods to effectively and reliably model
data. In previous studies, neighbourhoods as defined by local people (Winnipeg
and Regina studies), census tracts (Montr&#233;al, Edmonton and Halifax
studies) or dissemination areas (Thunder Bay and Saskatoon studies) were used
in the examination of geographical units.</p>
  <p>For the multivariate analyses in Section&#160;2.3, census tracts (CTs)
from the&#160;2006&#160;Census were used. Census tracts are small and relatively
stable areas usually having a population of&#160;2,500&#160;to&#160;8,000.
CT boundaries must meet many delimitation criteria designed to maximize their
use. For example, CT boundaries must be consistent with census subdivision
boundaries; they should as far as possible follow permanent and easily recognizable
physical features; and they should be as homogeneous as possible in terms
of socio-economic characteristics, that is, have similar economic status and
living conditions at the time of their creation. Only&#160;524&#160;of the&#160;531&#160;Toronto
CTs were included in the analyses because the remaining seven did not have
a large enough population.</p>
  <p>Most incidents were assigned to one CT based on their location. Other incidents,
located on the border between two or more CTs, were assigned to all the CTs
with which they shared a border. The number of incidents per CT is the sum
of all incidents assigned to that CT. However, in order not to count incidents
more than once, incidents assigned to more than one CT were downweighted.
For example, an incident located at the border of four CTs was counted as&#160;0.25&#160;incidents
for each of those four CTs.</p>
  <h4>4.5.2&#160;&#160;Normalizing transformations</h4>
  <p>Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is used to look at the distribution
of the rates of certain types of incidents based on neighbourhood characteristics.
Use of this method requires normally distributed continuous or quantitative
variables. Since several of the variables examined in this analysis were not
normally distributed, it was necessary to normalize the crime variables. Most
of the variables or neighbourhood characteristics were also modified (using
the natural logarithm or the square root) to give them a more normal distribution.</p>
  <h4>4.5.3&#160;&#160;Standardization</h4>
  <p>Regression coefficients (or beta coefficients) show the expected variation,
in standard deviation units, of the dependent variable per one standard deviation
unit increase of the independent variable when all other variables are held
constant. To allow comparisons among regression coefficients for a given model,
all the variables were standardized, except for the presence of a train or
subway station, whose only possible values are&#160;0&#160;and&#160;1. The
values thus vary from&#160;1&#160;(absolutely positive association) to &#8211;1&#160;(absolutely
negative association).</p>
  <h3>4.6&#160;&#160;Spatial autocorrelation and regression (by Krista Collins)</h3>
  <p>Data measured over a two-dimensional study area, such as geocoded criminal
incidents, are often affected by the properties of the location in which they
reside. If adjacent observations are affected by the same location properties,
the observations will not be independent of one another. This lack of independence
must be accounted for in the data analysis to produce accurate and unbiased
results. This is accomplished through spatial modelling of data and is important
for any data set where there is a potential effect of location.</p>
  <p>It is known that crime is not evenly distributed throughout cities and
that it is concentrated in particular areas known as hot spots. This is an
initial indication that there might be a location effect in crime data, which
can be seen by examining a map of crime density in city neighbourhoods. There
could be a positive effect where areas with high crime rates are surrounded
by other areas with high crime rates, and areas with low crime rates are adjacent
to other areas with low crime rates. A negative location effect results from
areas of low crime being surrounded by areas with high crime and vice versa.
Either scenario indicates some sort of spatial structure or spatial dependence
in the data, signifying that neighbourhoods have an influence on each other.
If the spatial structure of the data is not explained by the variables in
the regression model, then there will be spatial effects in the model error
terms. This phenomenon, which is known as spatial autocorrelation, violates
the assumptions made in a standard regression analysis. The location effects
must instead be accounted for in the multivariate model, to ensure accurate
estimation of the regression coefficients and their associated variances.</p>
  <p>For the purpose of spatial modelling, a definition of what constitutes
neighbouring locations needs to be specified. In this analysis, a contiguity
structure that includes all common borders or vertices that touch between
the boundaries of the regions is used to define regions (census tracts in
this document) as neighbours of each other. The neighbourhood structure defines
which locations have a potential influence on each other, the neighbours,
and rules out any potential influence of regions that are not considered to
be neighbours. The neighbourhood structure is used to test for spatial autocorrelation
and to specify the spatial component in the autoregressive spatial model.</p>
  <p>The basic process of modelling spatial data is to first fit a standard
least squares regression model to the data and then test the error terms for
the presence of spatial autocorrelation. This is done by a statistical test
called Moran's I, which tests whether the error terms are randomly distributed
over the study area. The value of the Moran's I statistic ranges from&#160;1&#160;to
&#8211;1. A value approaching&#160;1&#160;indicates the presence of positive
spatial autocorrelation, where regions with large error terms are adjacent
to other areas with large error terms. A negative value near <span class="nobr">-1</span>&#160;indicates
the presence of negative spatial autocorrelation, where regions with large
error terms are neighbouring regions with small error terms. A value near
zero indicates the absence of spatial autocorrelation. The significance of
Moran's I statistic is determined by a random permutation approach,
where a significant result indicates that there is spatial autocorrelation
in the model error terms.</p>
  <p>When spatial autocorrelation is detected in the residuals from a standard
least squares regression model, a spatial model must be fit to the data instead.
The spatial model provides the same analysis of the neighbourhood characteristics
as the least squares model but adjusts for the spatial effects. This can be
done in one of two ways: by adding an extra term to represent the effect of
neighbouring locations or by modelling a spatial process in the error terms.
In the former model, called the spatial lag model, a direct effect of the
crime rate in neighbouring locations is assumed. In this case the average
value from all neighbouring locations, termed the spatial lag, is added to
the regression model to represent the direct effect of the neighbouring regions.
The other model, termed the spatial error model, assumes the relationship
between crime rates in adjacent neighbourhoods is the result of the same relationship
of the explanatory variables in the adjacent neighbourhoods. Thus the spatial
autocorrelation, detected in the standard regression model, is the result
of spatially autocorrelated variables not present in the model. To determine
the appropriate type of spatial model to use for any given data set, the data
are empirically tested to determine the structure of the spatial dependency.</p>
  <p>The results from a spatial regression analysis are essentially the same
as those of other multivariate regression analyses. The regression coefficients
represent the change in the crime rate for a unit change in the variable,
when all other variables are held constant. Since the variables representing
the neighbourhood characteristics are standardised, the size of their regression
coefficients denote their relative contribution to the prediction of crime.
The spatial lag and spatial error regression coefficients, however, cannot
be explained in the same way. The spatial lag coefficient in part represents
the effect of neighbouring locations but also accounts for some of the measurement
error in using administrative units to define the neighbourhoods. Thus there
is no direct interpretation of the spatial lag coefficient. Similarly, the
spatial error coefficient represents a nuisance parameter in the model and
has no direct interpretation. Rather, the spatial term is only retained in
the model to make the other results accurate.</p>
  <p>The overall fit of the spatial models is assessed by the squared correlation
between the observed crime rate in each neighbourhood and the values predicted
using the spatial model. This squared correlation is equivalent to the coefficient
of determination (R<sup>2</sup>), commonly used in standard regression models,
where it represents the proportion of the variation explained by the regression
model. However, in the presence of spatial autocorrelation the squared correlation
between the observed and fitted values does not have the same interpretation.
Rather, it represents the relative fit of the model. A value of&#160;1&#160;would
represent a perfect fit of the model and values near zero indicate a poor
predictive power of the model.</p>
  <p>To ensure the spatial autocorrelation has been adequately accounted for
in the model, the residuals from the spatial model are tested for the presence
of spatial autocorrelation. This is done using Lagrange multiplier tests,
which test for the presence of spatial error dependence in the spatial lag
model and for a missing spatial lag variable in the spatial error model. If
the statistical test is not significant, it indicates the spatial dependence
in the data has been accounted for in the model.</p>
